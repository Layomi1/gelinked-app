                                way or introduces innovative features.</p>
    
                                <p> <span>Innovation and Creativity:</span>  Evaluate the uniqueness and creativity of the
                                    solution. Consider whether it addresses a real-world problem in a novel 
                                    way or introduces innovative features.</p>
                                    
                                <p><span> Impact and Relevance:</span> Determine the potential impact of the solution 
                                    in the real world. Does it address a significant problem, and is it relevant 
                                    to the target audience? Judges would assess the potential social, 
                                    economic, or environmental benefits.</p>
                                    
                                <p><span>Technical Complexity:</span>  Evaluate the technical sophistication of the solution. 
                                    Judges would consider the complexity of the code, the use of advanced 
                                    technologies or algorithms, and the scalability of the solution.</p>
    
                                <p><span>Adherence to Hackathon Rules:</span>  Judges will Ensure that the team adhered 
                                    to the rules and guidelines of the hackathon, including deadlines, use of 
                                    specific technologies or APIs, and any other competition-specific requirements.</p>
